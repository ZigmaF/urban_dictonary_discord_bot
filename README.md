Let the discord bot explain the uncommon, scary slang terms for your friends and fos in your server!

## 👨🏼‍💻 Download

```git clone https://github.com/ZigmaF/urban_dictonary_discord_bot.git```.

## 📌 Dependencies
- Sign up to [RapiAPI](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up) and generate you own private key. Make sure to not share your key with anyone. Make it accessable to the script by storing it in a variable. It is free. Store your rapidAPI key to an enviornment variable by adding this line to your ~/.zshrc:
- ```export API_KEY_RAPIDAPI_UD='your_api_key'```
- [JQ](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) command-line JSON processor
- Install with brew: 
- ```brew install jq```
- If you are using any other shell than oh my zsh, change the shebang to the appropriate path.

## 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run script
- Give the program execution permissions
```chmod +x /path/to/script/./init_ud_dbot```
- Run the script with the following command:
```/path/to/script/init_ud_dbot```

## 🤖 Make script run for every new shell
- Paste the following into the file ~/.zshrc:
```~/path/to/script/init_ud_dbot```
- Note if you are using another shell, for instance bash, the file would be ~/.bashrc.
